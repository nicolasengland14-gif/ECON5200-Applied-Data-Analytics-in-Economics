# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my applied data analytics repository! This portfolio showcases my journey in bridging traditional economic theory with modern machine learning techniques.

## 👋 About Me

I'm a graduate student specializing in data analysis with a focus on economic applications. My goal is to combine rigorous economic thinking with cutting-edge data science tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Data Analysis** where I can apply both causal inference frameworks and predictive modeling to solve real-world problems.

## 📚 About This Portfolio

This repository contains coursework and projects from **ECON 5200: Applied Data Analytics in Economics**. The course follows a **"Concept Extension"** philosophy—we start with foundational statistical methods you'd find in traditional econometrics, then scale them up using modern machine learning algorithms.

For example:
- **Classical Regression** → **Lasso & Ridge Regression**
- **Traditional Statistical Inference** → **Cross-Validation & Regularization**
- **Causal Inference** → **Predictive Analytics**

Through this approach, I'm learning to combine the interpretability and causal rigor of economics with the predictive power and scalability of data science.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **Statsmodels** - Statistical modeling and econometric analysis
- **Google Colab** - Cloud-based development environment

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:
- Labs and problem sets applying ML techniques to economic data
- Projects demonstrating the integration of causal inference and prediction
- Documented workflows showing data cleaning, exploration, modeling, and interpretation

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm building expertise in:
- Regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net)
- Model selection and cross-validation strategies
- Translating economic questions into data science problems
- Communicating technical findings to diverse audiences
